Summary:
Permanent PL/SQL Function to Validate and Debug Oracle CLOB Columns

Description:
While working with Oracle databases, CLOB columns often hold large logs or scripts that exceed standard VARCHAR limits. Testing and validation of these large values become time-consuming due to content size and complexity.

To address this, I developed a dynamic PL/SQL function that:
	•	Reads large CLOBs in chunks
	•	Performs substring search and validation
	•	Logs segments for traceability
	•	Can be reused across Oracle projects

This has significantly reduced testing/debugging time and introduced a reusable, production-ready solution.

Impact:
	•	Increased productivity and faster issue resolution
	•	Consistent validation process for all CLOB columns
	•	Can be shared as a central utility across teams

Innovation Title: Permanent Oracle CLOB Validation Function

Overview:
Oracle’s CLOB data type is essential for large text storage, but it lacks straightforward debugging and validation tools. To address frequent development and testing delays, I created a reusable PL/SQL utility.

Problem:
	•	Debugging large CLOBs is slow
	•	Difficult to extract specific segments
	•	Manual validation consumes effort and time

Solution:
	•	A dynamic PL/SQL function was developed to:
	•	Split CLOBs into readable/loggable chunks
	•	Support length checks and substring validation
	•	Integrate easily into existing stored procedures

Benefits:
	•	Saves time during testing and production debugging
	•	Enhances developer productivity
	•	Acts as a permanent utility for any Oracle-based project using CLOBs

Conclusion:
The function standardizes the way CLOB data is validated, enabling teams to save hours of manual effort and ensuring data reliability.
